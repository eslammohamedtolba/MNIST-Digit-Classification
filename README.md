# MNIST-Digit-Classification
This is a handwritten digits classifier model that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize and classify handwritten digits. 

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Overview of the Code
1-Load the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits, and display the dataset's information.

2-Visualize the first 10 images in the dataset.

3-Preprocess the images by scaling their pixel values to the range [0, 1].

4-Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for digit classification.

5-Compile and train the model using the training data.

6-Visualize the model's accuracy and loss during training.

7-Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

8-Make predictions on the test input images and create a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.

9-Build a predictive system that takes an image path as input, preprocesses the image, and uses the model to predict the digit in the image.

## Model Accuracy
The model achieves an accuracy of 96.5% on the test data.

## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome. You can help improve the model's accuracy, explore more advanced neural network architectures, or enhance the data preprocessing and visualization steps.
